## Data Sources

## Data cleaning 
I found some empty values   in price, quantity, and revenue and processed them using the arithmetic mean I also deleted duplicate data I described the data to understand it.

Which product had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?

What was the total quantity of products sold by the company?

Which category had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?

What was the average revenue per sale?

What was the total revenue generated in each quarter of the year? (i.e. Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
